# 1-on-1 Meeting Best Practices

## Manager Should AVOID:
• Dominating conversation (manager speaking much more than the 70:30 guideline where employee should speak more)
• Focusing only on work status updates
• Providing hasty feedback without sufficient evidence
  - presenting subjective interpretations/judgments without evidence
  - Excessive generalizations like "always" or "never"


## Manager Should STRIVE FOR:
• Creating safe environment (first 5 minutes for ice-breaking and relationship building)
• Using open-ended questions to encourage employee-led dialogue
• Covering diverse topics: work, growth, well-being, blockers, relationships, career development
• Facilitating two-way feedback exchange
• Setting clear action items with ownership and deadlines
• Effective feedback delivery approach:
  - Start with positive feedback first
  - Use Situation→Impact→Suggestion format for improvement feedback
  - Guide team members to self-discover improvements through coaching questions
• Last 5 minutes wrap-up:
  - Reflect on meeting effectiveness
  - Confirm action items for next meeting
