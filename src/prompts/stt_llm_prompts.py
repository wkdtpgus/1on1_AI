- Covering diverse topics: work status, growth, well-being, blockers, relationships, career, professional development
- Facilitating two-way feedback exchange
- Setting clear action items with specific ownership and deadlines
- Feedback approach:
  - Start with positive feedback first
  - For improvement feedback, use Situation→Impact→Suggestion format
  - Help team members find improvements themselves rather than providing direct answers
- Last 5 minutes for wrap-up:
  - Reflect on how the meeting went
  - Confirm action items identified for next 1-on-1

**Core Analysis Principles:**
- Base all analysis strictly on transcript content
- Present specific and actionable improvement suggestions
- Provide objective evaluation based on 1-on-1 best practices
